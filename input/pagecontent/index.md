### BFDR

[Birth and Fetal Death Vital Reporting]:
Birth and fetal death reporting includes the transmission of data from health care providers to jurisdictional vital records offices and national health statistics agencies. Data associated with the mother of the baby or delivered fetus may be communicated independently from data associated directly with the labor and delivery encounter at the responsible healthcare facility.

### VRCL

[Vital Records Common Library]:
This guide is a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) Profiles Library to support the needs of multiple vital records implementation guides (IGs). It does not provide any use case (scenario) specific content or additional guidance on how to use these artifacts, but serves as a source for a standard set of profiles for reuse in multiple use case specific IGs focusing on the exchange of vital records information. 

### MDI

[Medicolegal Death Investigation]:
This US-specific implementation guide (IG) provides guidance on the exchange of information to and from medicolegal death investigation (MDI) information systems. It supports interoperability between the MDI case management systems (CMS) used by medical examiner and coroner offices; forensic toxicology and other laboratory information management systems (LIMS); electronic death registration systems (EDRS) of jurisdictional vital records offices (VROs); and ancillary workflows whose systems have the capability of using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). This guide provides MDI CMS developers with the technical details and best practices to standardize MDI fields and interfaces. Stakeholders may use the narrative portions of this guide to inform policies and practices for data exchange between systems contributing to, and using information from, death investigations. This guide can serve as a base for local specifications.

### VRDR
[Vital Records Death Reporting]:
The VRDR FHIR IG provides guidance regarding the use of FHIR resources as a conduit for data required in the bidirectional exchange of mortality data between Jurisdictional Vital Records Offices (JVRO) in the US and U.S territories and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The VRDR FHIR IG will provide guidance for the use of standard FHIR resources as a conduit for data required by vital records death reporting. The use of FHIR as a platform for automation of vital records death reporting is expected to improve existing automation by enabling wide-scale adoption and leveraging the potential of electronic health records and clinical decision support systems.
