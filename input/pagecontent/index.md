### BFDR
[Birth and Fetal Death Vital Reporting]:

Birth and fetal death reporting includes the transmission of data from health care providers to jurisdictional vital records offices and national health statistics agencies. Data associated with the mother of the baby or delivered fetus may be communicated independently from data associated directly with the labor and delivery encounter at the responsible healthcare facility.

### VRCL
[Vital Records Common Library]:

This guide is a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) Profiles Library to support the needs of multiple vital records implementation guides (IGs). It does not provide any use case (scenario) specific content or additional guidance on how to use these artifacts, but serves as a source for a standard set of profiles for reuse in multiple use case specific IGs focusing on the exchange of vital records information.
